## Hi, I’m Sreenjoy Roy 👋

I’m a software developer and AI enthusiast who enjoys building practical, user-focused products using modern web technologies and artificial intelligence. I like working across the stack — from designing clean frontend interfaces to developing backend APIs, automation systems, and AI pipelines that actually solve real problems.

Currently, I’m pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) at the Institute of Engineering & Management, Kolkata. Over the last few years, I’ve focused on strengthening my fundamentals while also gaining hands-on experience through internships, projects, and hackathons. I enjoy fast-paced environments where learning, experimentation, and shipping real features go hand in hand.

My technical interests revolve around full-stack development and AI automation. I work mainly with React and JavaScript on the frontend, and Python-based frameworks like FastAPI on the backend. I also have practical experience with machine learning libraries, large language models, and agent-based systems, along with cloud deployment using AWS and Docker.

During my internship at TEOCO Software Pvt Ltd, I worked on building and deploying large-scale automation solutions. I contributed to developing over a hundred automation bots, modernized legacy scripts, and helped improve system performance and reliability. I also had the opportunity to collaborate closely with engineering and QA teams, which gave me a strong understanding of real-world software development workflows.

I’ve also worked with Indian Railways (SER Zone) as a Project Intern, where I gained exposure to backend systems and databases. There, I built automation scripts and data tools that improved server uptime and helped detect system anomalies, giving me experience with large, production-grade infrastructure.

On the projects side, I enjoy experimenting with AI-driven systems. I’ve built multi-agent AI applications for recruitment automation and financial analysis, using tools like LangChain, Hugging Face models, vector databases, and real-time APIs. These projects reflect my interest in combining clean backend design with intelligent automation.

Beyond development, I actively participate in competitive innovation. I was a finalist at Smart India Hackathon 2024 and have been recognized for my work in AI automation challenges. I’m always curious, always learning, and always looking for opportunities to build impactful software.

Feel free to explore my repositories — and if something catches your interest, I’d love to connect and collaborate.
